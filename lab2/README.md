# Lab 2: Introduction to Real-Time Operating Systems

## Objectives

This lab aims to provide hands-on experience with real-time system concepts and to develop a real-time application on a typical real-time operating system (RTOS).

## Tasks

### Task 3.1: Accessing a Shared Resource: I/O
- Analyze and modify the program `TwoTasks.c`.
- Implement the improved version as `TwoTasksImproved.c`.

### Task 3.2: Communication by Handshakes
- Implement communication between two tasks using semaphores in `Handshake.c`.

### Task 3.3: Shared Memory Communication
- Modify `Handshake.c` to implement shared memory communication in `SharedMemory.c`.

### Task 3.4: Context Switch
- Measure the context switch time and save the implementation as `ContextSwitch.c`.
