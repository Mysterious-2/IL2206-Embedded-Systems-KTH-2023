# Conclusion for Lab 1

## Summary

In this lab, we explored the Ada programming language, focusing on its concurrency features and real-time system support. We implemented a counting semaphore, solved the producer-consumer problem using different synchronization mechanisms, and experimented with real-time scheduling.

## Key Learnings

- Ada's protected objects provide a robust mechanism for concurrency.
- The rendezvous mechanism in Ada allows for direct communication between tasks.
- Real-time scheduling requires careful consideration of task priorities and system resources.

## Challenges

- Ensuring proper synchronization without causing deadlocks.
- Implementing real-time tasks that adhere to strict timing constraints.
