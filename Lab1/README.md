# Lab 1: Concurrent and Real-Time Software Development in Ada

## Objectives

The objective of this lab is to introduce the student to Ada and its features for concurrency and real-time systems.

## Tasks

1. **Semaphore Implementation** (Task 3.1):
   - Modify the provided package body to implement a counting semaphore.

2. **Producer-Consumer Problem** (Task 3.2):
   - Implement using a protected object.
   - Implement using the rendezvous mechanism.
   - Implement using semaphores.

3. **Real-Time Annex** (Task 3.3):
   - Implement periodic tasks with fixed priorities.
   - Implement rate-monotonic scheduling.
   - Detect overloads using a watchdog timer.
   - Implement mixed scheduling with background tasks.
